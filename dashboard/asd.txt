Update Via Edit Button and create name
Validation must be same.



single query data fetch projets
	description
	deliverable list
	assine count
	assigne lits
	archive

status
	active/inactive


because mam. view can be common for admin/users. 
so for each view even for single edit button, 
listing of any enity first we have to check privilege's of user/admin than show that particular view. 
and privilege's can be updated also.
and same goes for backend we have check at backend side also does user have privilage for any action.

our template is ready, schema is ready.
